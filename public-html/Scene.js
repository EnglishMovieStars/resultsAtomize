            Simba: Dad, you awake? Dad, wake up! Dad! Dad, Dad, Dad!
            <br />
            <br />
            Sarabi: Your son's awake.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mufasa: Before sunrise, he's your son.
            <br />
            <br />
            Simba: Come on, Dad, let's go. You said I could patrol with you
            today. And today has started. You promised! You up? Let's do this!
            <br />
            <br />
            Mufasa: Let's do this.
            <br />
            <br />
            Simba: So, what's first? Give orders for the hunt? Chase away evil
            intruders? Dad! You're going the wrong way! Dad? I'm not supposed to
            go up here.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mufasa: Look, Simba. Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
            <br />
            <br />
            Simba: You rule all of that?
            <br />
            <br />
            Mufasa: Yes. But a king's time as ruler... rises and falls like the
            sun. One day, Simba... the sun will set on my time here... and will
            rise with you as the new king.
            <br />
            <br />
            Simba: All of this will belong to me?
            <br />
            <br />
            Mufasa: It belongs to no one, but will be yours to protect. A great
            responsibility.
            <br />
            <br />
            Simba: Everything the light touches? Those trees? And the watering
            hole? And that mountain? And beyond those shadows?
            <br />
            <br />
            Mufasa: You must not go there, Simba.
            <br />
            <br />
            Simba: But I thought a king could do whatever he wants. Take any
            territory.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mufasa: While others search for what they can take... a true king
            searches for what he can give. Everything you see exists together in
            a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand that
            balance...and respect all the creatures... from the crawling ant to
            the leaping antelope.
            <br />
            <br />
            Simba: But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
            <br />
            <br />
            Mufasa: Yes, Simba. But let me explain. When we die, our bodies
            become the grass... and the antelope eat the grass... and so we are
            all connected in the great circle of life.
